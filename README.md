# nba_stats_website

# About (so far)
This website is using a python web scrape of basketball-reference.com. The data from the scrape is then used in the website to display information about players that the user inputs through an HTML form. This info is transferred to and from the HTML page using Flask @app routes. 

# Stage
The site is only at the point that a user types a players name (no spelling errors allowed) and then gets back the names and their PPG / APG side by side.
